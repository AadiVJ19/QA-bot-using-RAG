# QA-bot-using-RAG
# QA Bot with RAG and Pinecone

A Question-Answering (QA) bot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Pinecone vector database for efficient information retrieval and response generation.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for accurate and context-aware responses
- **Pinecone Integration** for efficient vector similarity search
- **Fine-tuning capabilities** for domain-specific improvements
- **Optimized retrieval** techniques for better performance

## Project Structure

- `qa_bot_rag_pinecone.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the QA bot implementation
- `dataset_preparation_fine_tuning.md`: Documentation on dataset preparation and fine-tuning process
- `rag_optimization_techniques.md`: Techniques and best practices for optimizing RAG performance

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pinecone account and API key
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Set up your Pinecone API key
4. Run the Jupyter notebook `qa_bot_rag_pinecone.ipynb`

## Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter notebook
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook
3. Input your questions and get accurate, context-aware responses

## Fine-tuning

For information on how to prepare your dataset and fine-tune the model for specific domains, refer to `dataset_preparation_fine_tuning.md`.

## Optimization

Check out `rag_optimization_techniques.md` for various techniques to optimize the performance of your RAG-based QA system.
